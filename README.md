# 💎 XandOS: Diamond Sovereign Analytics

XandOS is an **industrial-grade, high-fidelity analytics platform** designed for the Xandeum Storage Layer. It transforms complex gossip protocol metadata and raw pRPC packet streams into an immersive, actionable intelligence suite.

Built with a "Diamond Sovereign" design philosophy, XandOS provides node operators and network analysts with a 360-degree view of the storage ecosystem, ensuring network transparency and competitive performance tracking.

## 🚀 Key Modules & Features

### 1. Network Sovereignty (Intelligence Overview)

The Command Center of the platform. It provides a high-level briefing on the total network capacity and node health.

- **Magnitude Encoding:** Real-time KPI matrix showing Total Nodes, Active Pods, and Cumulative Storage (EB/PB/TB).
- **Dynamic Deltas:** Real-time tracking of growth velocity (e.g., +12.5 PB / 24H) with semantic color-coding.
- **Capacity Ranking:** Professional bar charts highlighting the top 10 storage whales in the cluster.
- **Credit Distribution:** Area charts visualizing the reputation density across the entire network.

### 2. Node Registry (The Refractive Ledger)

A high-density technical database of every active pNode appearing in the gossip network.

- **Tactical Filtering:** Multi-tag system allowing analysts to drill down by Status (Online/Syncing/Offline) or Geographic Sharding (Region).
- **Memory Allocation Bars:** Dual-tone liquid gradient tubes showing real-time Shard usage vs. Committed Storage.
- **Integrity Scores:** Visual verification indicators showing the handshake stability of each segment.

### 3. Global Radar (Neural Geospatial Monitor)

A holographic 2D projection of the global Xandeum footprint.

- **Cluster Visualization:** Dynamic marker sizing that scales based on regional node density.
- **Radar Sweep:** An animated conic-gradient scan providing a "Live-Monitor" atmosphere.
- **Sector Lens:** Interactive holographic tooltips providing telemetry data for specific geographic clusters.

### 4. Gossip Stream (Neural Terminal)

The heartbeat of the system. This module proves technical mastery by visualizing the raw protocol communication.

- **Live Packet Log:** A multi-colored scrolling terminal showing handshakes, storage proofs, and metric commits.
- **Mesh Integrity HUD:** A concentric pulsing radar representing the health of the gossip peer-to-peer mesh.
- **Protocol Specs:** Technical readouts of encryption types (AES), CPU sharding, and latency averages.

### 5. Hall of Champions (Championship Leaderboard)

A competitive hierarchy designed to drive performance and retention among storage providers.

- **3D Podium:** Visual ranking of the Top 3 "Legendary Status" nodes with asymmetric scaling.
- **Performance Credits:** Dynamic sorting of 240+ nodes based on real-time performance credits earned.
- **ROI Analytics:** High-level metrics on epoch work and validator return-on-investment.

### 6. Forensic Node Audit (Deep Deep-Dive)

A dedicated interface for auditing a single specific pNode identity.

- **Telemetry Readout:** Deep-dive into specific node versions, packet throughput (In/Out), and risk scores.
- **Export Utility:** Functional logic to download a node's technical audit as a professional JSON log.

## 🛠 Elite Tech Stack

I chose a **High-Performance "Prism" Stack** to ensure the platform feels like a native desktop OS:

- **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) for high-speed server-side data aggregation.
- **Data Engine:** [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for efficient, lightweight global state management of gossip data.
- **Visualization:** [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for scientific-grade analytics and [React Simple Maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) for geospatial HUDs.
- **Motion:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for liquid state transitions and refractive glass animations.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a modular, utility-first "Diamond" design system.

## 📡 Data Engineering & Innovation

To meet the Xandeum Bounty requirements, XandOS implements several custom engineering solutions:

- **pRPC Aggregator:** A custom server-side pipeline that queries multiple Xandeum seed IPs in parallel, deduplicates the results, and normalizes the data for the UI.
- **Unit Conversion Logic:** Real-time transformation of raw bytes into human-readable industrial units (Exabytes/Petabytes).
- **Neural Geo-Mapper:** A high-performance IP-prefix mapping system that identifies the geographic region of pNodes without external API overhead.
- **Relative Time Sync:** Custom logic to derive "Online/Offline" status by comparing pNode timestamps against live server time.

## 📦 Installation & Local Deployment

1. **Clone the Identity:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mdabdullah3/XandOS
```

2. **Initialize Environment:**

```bash
   npm install
```

3. **Commence Development:**

```bash
   npm run dev
```

4. **Vercel Deployment:**
   The project is optimized for Vercel. Ensure `legacy-peer-deps=true` is set in your .npmrc to handle React 19 compatibility.
